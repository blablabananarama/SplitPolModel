# SplitPolModel

This is our try to build a modelling module for the iGEM community. Our 
effort aims to provide a framework to solve simple modelling questions in an 
easy-to-use interface. Without the knowledge of proper coding we still hope 
that we can create a satisfying solution.

Cheers,

Code w/ care
